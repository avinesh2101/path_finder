## What is this application all aboutðŸ’»
This application visualizes Dijkstra Algorithm in action.The algorithms on this application are adapted for a 2D grid, where 90 degree turns have a "cost" of 1 and movements from a node to another have a "cost" of 1.Purpose of this application -
#### The sole purpose of this application is to help student easily understand dijkstra algorithm by visualizing it in their brains.
[Check working app](https://visualizerdijkstra.herokuapp.com/)

### How to modify this app ?
Just clone it and write 
</br>
npm i
</br> 
in yout terminal and after that if you want to add new algorithm visualization write the algortihm in algo directory and add its button or make a dropdown in navbar . 



### Idea inpiration 
I got the inpiration to make this app from clementmi hailescu.


### Deployment
This project is hosted on heroku platform you can check it using https://visualizerdijkstra.herokuapp.com/
