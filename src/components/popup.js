            <h1>What the hell is Dijkstra ??ðŸ™„</h1>
            <p>Dijkstra's algorithm is used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a 
            graph, which may represent,road networks and have many application like in <i>IP routing,Social Networking Applications,Digital Mapping Services in Google Maps.....etc etc.</i>
            <b>It always gurantes shortes path between two node.</b>
            for its implementation and use in problem solving with refer my code  <a href="https://github.com/avinesh2101/Graph-and-related-stuff.git">(fyi: my code is shitty go read some good articlesðŸ¥±)</a></p>

            <h1>What is this application all aboutðŸ’»</h1>
             This application visualizes
 <b> Dijkstra Algorithm </b>in action.The algorithms on this application are adapted for a 2D grid, 
where 90 degree turns have a "cost" of 1 and movements from a node to 
another have a "cost" of 1.
<b>Purpose of this application -</b> The sole purpose of this application is to s
 {/* showcase my development skills */}
   help student easily understand dijkstra algorithm by visualizing it in their brains.
